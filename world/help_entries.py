File-based help entries. These complements command-based help and help entries
added in the database using the `sethelp` command in-game.

Control where Evennia reads these entries with `settings.FILE_HELP_ENTRY_MODULES`,
which is a list of python-paths to modules to read.

A module like this should hold a global `HELP_ENTRY_DICTS` list, containing
dicts that each represent a help entry. If no `HELP_ENTRY_DICTS` variable is
given, all top-level variables that are dicts in the module are read as help
entries.

Each dict is on the form
::

    {'key': <str>,
     'category': <str>,   # optional, otherwise settings.DEFAULT_HELP_CATEGORY
     'aliases': <list>,   # optional
     'text': <str>}``     # the actual help text. Can contain # subtopic sections
