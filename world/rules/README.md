# Rules

## Guideline

While making a rule. Do not forget that the design of this game is intended to be based around chance.

All positives should increase the chance of success and all negatives should decrease the chance of success.

Do what can be done to reduce the known outcome of an encounter. While still allowing the player to succeed overall.
